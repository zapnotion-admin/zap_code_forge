engine/brief.py
Manages the ZAP_CODEFORGE_BRIEF.md file in the project folder.

The brief is a small structured text file that persists across pipeline runs.
It tells every stage what the project is, what's been decided, and what to avoid.
This prevents the model from rediscovering the same problems every run.

Format (plain markdown, human-editable):

  ## Goal
  ## Current State
  ## Decisions Made
  ## Do Not Change
